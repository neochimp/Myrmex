# Myrmex

Cameron Lee, Jordan Tobin, Camden Ho

Myrmex is an ant life simulator. It is the sole duty of the player to maintain their colony. Throughout the game, the player will take on the role of either a Worker or a Soldier, fulfilling their respective tasks of collecting food or defending the colony against enemies. The player will explore a procedurally-generated world ridden with rough terrain and increasingly tough enemies. Living as an ant is an arduous task, especially if one's vision is limited. Players and other ants must rely on pheromone trails to find their way to food and enemies. The difficulty of the enemies will be based on the distance from the nest. Lower-quality food and less challenging enemies will spawn closer to the nest, while high-quality food and stronger enemies will spawn further away from the nest. Fail to complete your tasks, and the colony will crumble. Submit to the collective consciousness.
